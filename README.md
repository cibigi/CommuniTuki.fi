Hi,
My name is Christian and I’m a sixteen years old Italian student. CommuniTuki.fi is my project for “Hack The Crisis, Finland”.

Coronavirus is spreading fast and everyone’s life is suddenly changing. People must stay home to be safe.

Staying home can be kind of fun, but on the long run it is exhausting. People miss friends, places, experiences.

We’re moving our lives on the internet. Smart-working, online lessons, entertainment.

My project’s purpose is creating an hub for internet experiences, useful services and Covid-19 data.

Logo and visual identity
The logo is a revisitation of Finland’s national flag. The borders become tridimensional, they look like home… a safe place. The cross evolves in a fluid figure simulating the warmth, the comfort and the of the domestic environment

CommuniTuki.fi uses Finland Toolbox design guidelines.
